# EduGuard – Student Performance & Dropout Risk Analyzer

EduGuard is an intermediate-level data science project that predicts student academic performance and identifies early dropout risk using machine learning.

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions often struggle to identify students at academic risk early. This project aims to analyze academic and behavioral data to support early intervention.

## Features Used
- Attendance percentage  
- Study time  
- Absences  
- Internal marks  

## Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Random Forest Classification
- Confusion Matrix & Model Evaluation

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Outcome
The model predicts student performance and highlights key risk factors, helping institutions take proactive action.
